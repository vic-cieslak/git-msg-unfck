- there is issue in git push/pull after commits are rewritten?

```
git push
To github.com:vic-cieslak/git-msg-unfck.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:vic-cieslak/git-msg-unfck.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. If you want to integrate the remote changes,
hint: use 'git pull' before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```


- remove double quotes from commit messages.

- "why" flag should be optionally passable or always present?

- add ability to set openrouter token using smth like

```
unfck set-token
unfck configure
```

- add feature -> if commit contains meaninfgul message skip it.


- limitations - might not process long git diffs / big changes (to be implemented)

- change name to git-msg-ai-fixer ?? git-msg-ai-fix ??

- gather feedback from users.
